# Pipeline Operator Guide

This guide is for people and agents who need to run the package or adjust the
agent context it provides.

## Command Cheat Sheet

Use either binary name:

```shell
pipe ...
oisin-pipeline ...
```

`pipe "<task>"`

Runs the default workflow directly. The `pipe` binary treats a non-command first
argument as `run`.

```shell
pipe "Implement PIPE-123"
```

`pipe run "<task>"`

Runs a workflow from `.pipeline/pipeline.yaml`. Without flags, this selects the
configured `default_workflow`.

```shell
pipe run "Implement PIPE-123"
pipe run --workflow inspect "Inspect this repo"
pipe run --entrypoint epic PIPE-31
```

`pipe pipe "<task>"`

Alias for `run`.

```shell
pipe pipe "Implement PIPE-123"
```

`pipe inspect "<task>"`

Runs the configured read-only inspection entrypoint. This is equivalent to
`pipe run --entrypoint inspect ...`.

```shell
pipe inspect "Explain the app structure and available checks"
```

`pipe epic "<task-or-epic-id>"`

Runs the `epic-drain` entrypoint. The current epic flow researches the epic,
routes child tickets into fixed tracks, runs those tracks in parallel worktrees,
drain-merges passing branches, and then runs hardened review.

```shell
pipe epic PIPE-31
```

`pipe validate`

Validates the YAML config and compiles the selected workflow.

```shell
pipe validate
pipe validate --entrypoint epic
pipe validate --workflow epic-drain
pipe validate --strict
pipe validate --no-lint
```

Normal validation emits lint warnings without failing. `--strict` promotes lint
warnings to failures. `--no-lint` skips lint warnings and keeps schema/plan
validation.

`pipe explain-plan`

Prints the compiled workflow topology, including batches, nodes, runners, gates,
hooks, and artifacts.

```shell
pipe explain-plan
pipe explain-plan --entrypoint epic
pipe explain-plan --workflow inspect
```

`pipe doctor`

Checks local prerequisites and pipeline config health.

```shell
pipe doctor
```

`pipe init`

Scaffolds the default pipeline files.

```shell
pipe init
pipe init --overwrite
```

`pipe install-commands`

Generates host-native command surfaces from the YAML config.

```shell
pipe install-commands --host all
pipe install-commands --host codex --check
pipe install-commands --host claude --dry-run
pipe install-commands --host all --force
```

Host choices are `all`, `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `kimi`, and `pi`.

Generated invocations include:

```text
Claude/OpenCode/Kimi/Pi: /pipe, /inspect, /epic
Codex:                 $pipe, $inspect, $epic
```

Set `PIPELINE_TARGET_PATH=/path/to/repo` when invoking the CLI from outside the
target worktree.

## How The Package Works

The runtime is config-driven. These three files are the source of truth:

```text
.pipeline/runners.yaml   runner adapters and capabilities
.pipeline/profiles.yaml  reusable profiles, rules, skills, and MCP servers
.pipeline/pipeline.yaml  entrypoints, workflows, hooks, gates, and artifacts
```

Current entrypoints:

```yaml
entrypoints:
  pipe:
    workflow: default
  inspect:
    workflow: inspect
  epic:
    workflow: epic-drain
```

Current default workflow:

```text
research -> red -> green -> acceptance -> verify -> learn
```

Current `epic-drain` workflow:

```text
research -> plan -> implement(parallel: test, frontend, backend, k8s) -> merge -> review
```

Workflow nodes are strict by `kind`:

- `kind: agent` launches a configured profile.
- `kind: command` runs a subprocess command.
- `kind: builtin` runs built-in runtime behavior such as `drain-merge`.
- `kind: workflow` invokes another named workflow, optionally in an isolated
  worktree.
- `kind: parallel` runs a fixed set of child nodes concurrently.

Structural parallelism is fixed in YAML. Routing agents can decide which work
belongs to each declared track, but they do not create new tracks dynamically.

`kind: workflow` worktrees support `${runId}` and `${nodeId}`:

```yaml
worktree_root: .pipeline/runs/${runId}/frontend
```

`drain-merge` consumes the output from parallel workflow children, skips failed
or non-worktree children, checks that mergeable branches share a base SHA, and
merges passing branches into an integration branch in declaration order. It
reports conflicts for manual resolution and does not auto-resolve them.

## Adding Skills

Skills are declared in `.pipeline/profiles.yaml` under the top-level `skills`
registry:

```yaml
skills:
  accessibility-review:
    path: .agents/skills/accessibility-review/SKILL.md
```

Then grant the skill to a profile:

```yaml
profiles:
  pipeline-frontend-reviewer:
    runner: codex
    instructions:
      path: .pipeline/prompts/frontend-reviewer.md
    skills: [accessibility-review]
    tools: [read, list, grep, glob, bash]
    filesystem:
      mode: read-only
    network:
      mode: inherit
```

Workflow nodes do not accept `skills` directly. A node selects a profile, and
the profile supplies the skills:

```yaml
workflows:
  ui-review:
    nodes:
      - id: review
        kind: agent
        profile: pipeline-frontend-reviewer
```

If only one node needs a different skill set, create a narrow profile for that
node. Do not broaden a shared profile unless every node using that profile
should receive the new skill.

Skills are validated in two ways:

- The profile can only reference skills declared in the top-level registry.
- The referenced skill file must exist unless validation is intentionally run in
  a mode that allows missing lint file references. Normal `pipe validate` emits
  a warning for missing skill files; `pipe validate --strict` fails on that
  warning.

The selected runner must also advertise `capabilities.skills: true`; otherwise
validation rejects the profile grant.

## Adding MCP Servers

MCP servers are also declared in `.pipeline/profiles.yaml`, under the top-level
`mcp_servers` registry.

For a local stdio MCP server:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  docs:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@example/docs-mcp"]
    env:
      DOCS_TOKEN: token
```

For a remote HTTP MCP server:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  memory:
    url: https://memory-mcp.momokaya.ee/mcp/
    bearer_token_env_var: MEMORY_MCP_TOKEN
    headers:
      X-Memory-Region: eu
```

Exactly one of `command` or `url` is required. `args` and `env` are only valid
for command servers. `headers` and `bearer_token_env_var` are only valid for URL
servers.

You can also reference an existing `.mcp.json` server:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  serena:
    ref:
      path: .mcp.json
      id: serena
```

If `id` is omitted, the registry key is used:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  backlog:
    ref:
      path: .mcp.json
```

Grant MCP servers to profiles:

```yaml
profiles:
  pipeline-router:
    runner: codex
    instructions:
      path: .pipeline/prompts/router.md
    mcp_servers: [backlog, github-readonly]
    tools: [read, list, grep, glob, bash]
    filesystem:
      mode: read-only
    network:
      mode: inherit
```

Then use that profile from a node:

```yaml
workflows:
  route:
    nodes:
      - id: plan
        kind: agent
        profile: pipeline-router
```

As with skills, nodes do not accept `mcp_servers` directly. The node gets MCP
access through its profile. For a one-off grant, create a one-off profile.

The selected runner must advertise `capabilities.mcp_servers: true`; otherwise
validation rejects the profile grant.

## Practical Pattern

Use profiles as capability bundles:

```yaml
profiles:
  pipeline-security-reviewer:
    runner: codex
    instructions:
      path: .pipeline/prompts/security-reviewer.md
    skills: [security-and-hardening, semgrep]
    mcp_servers: [serena, semgrep, github-readonly]
    tools: [read, list, grep, glob, bash]
    filesystem:
      mode: read-only
    network:
      mode: inherit
```

Then assign nodes to the smallest profile that has exactly the context they
need:

```yaml
workflows:
  security-pass:
    nodes:
      - id: review
        kind: agent
        profile: pipeline-security-reviewer
```

After changing skills, MCP servers, profiles, or workflows, run:

```shell
pipe validate --strict
pipe explain-plan --workflow <workflow-id>
pipe install-commands --host all --check
```

## Profile Grant Rules To Remember

Agent context is profile-owned:

```text
workflow node -> profile -> rules, skills, MCP servers, tools, filesystem, network, output
```

Nodes choose profiles; they do not carry `skills` or `mcp_servers` directly.
When one node needs special context, create a narrow profile for that node
instead of widening a shared profile.

Adding a skill always has two steps:

```yaml
skills:
  accessibility-review:
    path: .agents/skills/accessibility-review/SKILL.md

profiles:
  pipeline-frontend-reviewer:
    runner: codex
    instructions:
      path: .pipeline/prompts/frontend-reviewer.md
    skills: [accessibility-review]
```

Adding an MCP server also has two steps:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  docs:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@example/docs-mcp"]

profiles:
  pipeline-router:
    runner: codex
    instructions:
      path: .pipeline/prompts/router.md
    mcp_servers: [docs]
```

Remote MCP servers use `url`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  memory:
    url: https://memory-mcp.momokaya.ee/mcp/
    bearer_token_env_var: MEMORY_MCP_TOKEN
```

Existing MCP JSON entries can be imported by reference:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  backlog:
    ref:
      path: .mcp.json
```

The selected runner must advertise the capability it is being asked to use:

```yaml
runners:
  codex:
    capabilities:
      skills: true
      mcp_servers: true
```

After changing profile grants or registries, check all three surfaces:

```shell
pipe validate --strict
pipe explain-plan --workflow <workflow-id>
pipe install-commands --host all --check
```
