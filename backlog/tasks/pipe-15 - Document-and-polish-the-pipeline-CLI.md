## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Replace the default Mastra README with practical operating documentation for this repository and make the CLI entrypoint clear for local use. A future user should be able to install dependencies, choose a harness, run the pipeline, and understand generated artifacts without reading the source first.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 README explains the pipeline purpose, lifecycle, supported harnesses, and generated artifacts.
- [x] #2 README documents required tools, environment variables, and exact verification commands.
- [x] #3 A documented command or package script runs `work-next` with a task description.
- [x] #4 CLI input validation reports unsupported harness values clearly before starting a run.
- [x] #5 Documentation explains known limitations and how Backlog.md tickets map to the pipeline phases.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
Implementation plan:
1. Work in dedicated `wt` branch/worktree `pipe-15-cli-docs` based on current `main`.
2. Update README with final pipeline purpose, lifecycle, supported harnesses, environment variables, artifacts, verification commands, and Backlog phase mapping.
3. Add or document a package script for `work-next` and improve CLI harness validation so unsupported `PIPELINE_HARNESS` values fail before starting a run.
4. Add focused tests for CLI validation/script behavior where appropriate.
5. Run `bun run test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run check`, and `bun run build`; commit scoped branch changes before handoff.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Expanded README with final pipeline purpose, lifecycle, supported harnesses, environment variables, generated artifacts, Backlog phase mapping, known limitations, and exact verification commands. Added `bun run work-next` package script. Added CLI validation for unsupported `PIPELINE_HARNESS` before Backlog tasks or workflow runs start, with focused tests. Verification passed on main: `bun run test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run check`, and `bun run build`. Merged implementation commit: 48b4965.
