## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add declarative hooks as runtime callbacks owned by the pipeline engine. Hooks should be command or builtin callbacks on known workflow/node/gate lifecycle events. They must not be arbitrary in-process JS or TS functions in v1.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Supported hook events include workflow start, workflow success, workflow failure, workflow complete, node start, node success, node error, and gate failure.
- [x] #2 Hooks can run command or builtin callbacks with configured timeout, required/optional behavior, and templated runtime variables.
- [x] #3 Required hook failure fails the relevant workflow stage; optional hook failure is recorded but does not block execution.
- [x] #4 Hooks are executed by the pipeline runtime, not by model agents.
- [x] #5 Tests cover hook event dispatch, templating, timeout behavior, required failure, optional failure, and ordering.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Implemented declarative command/builtin lifecycle hooks for workflow, node, and gate events with templating, timeout plumbing, and required versus optional failure behavior.
