## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 CLI uses a real command framework for work-next and install-commands
- [x] #2 install-commands can install all supported host adapters
- [x] #3 Installer supports idempotent update, dry-run, check, and force behavior
- [x] #4 Generated files are marked as package-owned and manual edits are protected
<!-- AC:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Added Commander-based CLI dispatch for work-next and install-commands. Implemented generated command installation for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi with package-owned markers, idempotent updates, dry-run, check, and force semantics. Added tests covering all-host installation, idempotency, check failures, dry-run, manual-edit protection, and force overwrite. Verified with full tests, typecheck, Ultracite check, build, npm publish dry-run, and packed consumer install proof.
